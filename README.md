# Data-Science-Basics
This Repository is all about learning the basics of Data Science using Python.

In this repository I wanted to upload and keep track of the assignments I did while learning the concepts of Data Science using Python.
Currently(April,2021) I have started an online course from coursera - "Introduction to Data Science in Python" offered by University of Michigan.
The assignments have been taken from that course.

Hope to increase contents as I keep learning. Feel free to contact me if you have any relevant queries.
